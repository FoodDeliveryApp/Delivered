# Delivered
## CSC322 Software Engineering Final Project
Created by: Chrystal Mingo, Marina Skachko, Maya Dara Sofia Pasiliao, Mayra Vazquez-Sanchez

CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, Jquery were used to build Delivered. We decided on a web based GUI, as that is what our team is most familiar with. To enable log in functionality, usernames and passwords are stored in a database. The front end was all written using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. A Google API was used to display the map for the delivery subsystem and to calculate shortest route. JavaScript was used to display ratings, dropped items, and customer orders.

Half the system uses PostgreSQL. However, we underestimated the time it would take to integrate all the pages using our database, and had to switch to using txt files.
